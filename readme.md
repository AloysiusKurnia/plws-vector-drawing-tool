# PseudoLW's Vector Drawing Tool

This is a vector drawing tool that I made for my own use. It is not intended to be a full-featured vector drawing tool, but rather a tool that I can use to quickly draw simple vector graphics for use in my own projects. Feel free to use it, though. Fork it, modify it, whatever. Just credit me, though. (It will be in the license, wink wink.)

## How to use

Clone, install packages, then `npm run build` or whatever you use to run node scripts. I personally use pnpm.

A file will be created in the `dist` folder. Open `index.html` in your browser. (You don't need a server.)
