# Four Critters of the Apocalypse

## Hildiz

/ˈhɪl.dɪz/. She. Incarnation of war. Aka Hild.

While she represents hatred and revenge, she's actually pretty friendly if you don't mess up with her. She seeks to give an equal revenge to the people who has been wronged, according to her own judgement (which might be morally funky at times). Basically she is the embodiment of the phrase "eye for an eye".

Other than that, she likes to trade stuffs, especially antique weapons, which she has a collection of. However, there's one dagger that is very personal to her. It is very durable and useful, and she uses that for all her needs.

Owning a cache of gold in her house, she's undoubtedly the richest of four. She use this to trade with people from far away with no regard of currency. She often doesn't mind to share stuffs, but at times her instinct kicks her to be extra greedy when it comes to chances.

Also, while she can't read, she's really good with numbers when it comes to currency. She also really likes puzzle and is a good at strategy. This makes her gets very good at games, even beating Hung on certain genres.

## Kutho

/ˈku.θɔ(ː)/. She. Incarnation of conquest. Aka Kuth.

Owns a local clinic and apothecary in which she also works. Her working procedure is oftentimes dodgy to modern standards, but somehow works. Think of a medieval medical procedure. However, she's still a medic of choice in the town, due to the fact that she behaves very kind to her patients. She tries her hardest to cure her patients, and will get very distressed when people die in her sight. When this happens, she may rant to Hung, if she can find him that is.

On her free time, she choose to sleep or read books. She's a very light sleeper and can be waken up at any time. Because of this, she tries steal as many times as possible to take a quick nap, often at work.

Ironically, she doesn't really care about the tidiness of her personal room (though of course she cleans her clinic regularly). She's very lazy to do things that she doesn't need to do. Dauth really don't appreciate this.

She also can use a crossbow. Once in a while, she may hunt with Hild, looking for medicinal materials.

## Hun(g)hruz

/ˈhʊŋ(k).hrʊz/. He. Incarnation of famine. Aka Hung. May be spelt with or without g.

A loner who loves walking alone while enjoying his surrounding. While he love to help and comfort people around him to get them through their problem, he's just so hard to find around. He himself has his own problem, but never seem to like the idea of spilling it to his friend. Just knowing to try to help his friends is enough to make him happy.

While he does cook the best out of the four, he himself only very rarely eat. He seems to be conditioned by his starvation, though this sometimes made him hard to think straight which can be problematic when trying to help people. The thing is, he only cooks when he's in mood to do so, but he will not buy any ready-made food. As such, his friends once in a while offer him to cook together.

When he's not outside, he may be found playing games at his own home, often either with Hild or Dauth.

## Dauthuz

/ˈd(ɑw, ɔː).θʊz/. He. Incarnation of death. Aka Dauth.

Packed with energy, this boy is a playful little friend. He don't mind having a chat with everyone, no matter who it is. He's extremely talkative, even almost annoying sometimes. That doesn't stop his friend for liking him, though. Still, his friend will never give any secrets to him because he's very sloppy with his mouth.

He keeps a scythe with him, but that thing is mainly used for lawnmowing. He owns a very large garden and love to clean it every single day. He also trim the other three's bush, for free or sometimes tipped. In short, he took cleaning stuffs really seriously. His friends told him to make this his job, so he did.

He's very forgiving, but all of this is because he is forgetful. He's very bad at memory, and so he likes to write things around. Because of this, he also love to write. He often asks Kutho to come when she's free (he will never go to her house due to how untidy it is) to talk about stories and other ideas.
